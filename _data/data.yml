experiences:
    - role: Frontend Developer
      time: 2019 - Present
      company: Diconium digital solutions
      details: |
        Working as a Software developer for an e-commerce platform for selling handheld power equipment. The platform is in constant change,
        so all sorts of new features were developed - from new checkout logic to analytics - but this
        also resulted in the need for several bug fixes. While assigned to this project, I worked mainly as a Front-end developer,
        but I could still develop several functionalities in the middleware (Adobe IO), and in the CMS (Adobe Experience Manager).
        Scrum was the chosen agile framework for this project and we were able to successfully go live in two countries, with different languages.

         
          - One of the things I enjoyed the most was having the opportunity to share my React/JS knowledge with colleagues from all over the company in a 'React Bootcamp'.
          - Technologies used: JavaScript (React, Redux), HTML/CSS, some JAVA
          
    - role: Investigation
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company: FCT NOVA
      details: |
        Created and implemented a context-based automatic adaptation model for Geographic Information Systems
        (GIS). Throughout this investigation I was responsible for creating a Web application where knowledgeable
        system administrators are able to define automatic adaptations for an Android application. This Android
        application for tourism was built as a proof of concept for the model. The application reads what the administrators
        defined on the configuration platform and changes its behaviour according to the specifications. As it
        was built as a tourism application, it was supported by points of interest which were stored on a separate
        server, also created and implemented throughout the investigation.
        

          - Technologies used on the Configuration Platform: Node.js/Express.js, Angular, MongoDB
          - Technologies used on the Android application: Java
          - Technologies used on the Configuration Platform: Node.js/Express.js, PostgreSQL, PostGIS
          
    - role: Software Developer (Internship)
      time: 2016 - 2017 (5 mos)
      company: B-Guest
      details: |
        Responsible for building a tablet application for simplifying the check-in process on hotels. This application was built from scratch
        using the NativeScript framework, which reads Angular/TypeScript code and generates both iOS and Android application
        files. Througout this internship I also helped build some new features on the company's main Web application and API.

          - Technologies used: NativeScript, Angular
