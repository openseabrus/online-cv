experiences:
    - role: Investigation
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company: FCT NOVA
      details: |
        Created and implemented a context-based automatic adaptation model for Geographic Information Systems
        (GIS). Throughout this investigation I was responsible for creating a Web application where knowledgeable
        system administrators are able to define automatic adaptations for an Android application. This Android
        application for tourism was built as a proof of concept for the model. The application reads what the administrators
        defined on the configuration platform and changes its behaviour according to the specifications. As it
        was built as a tourism application, it was supported by points of interest which were stored on a separate
        server, also created and implemented throughout the investigation.
        

          - Technologies used on the Configuration Platform: Node.js/Express.js, Angular, MongoDB
          - Technologies used on the Android application: Java
          - Technologies used on the Configuration Platform: Node.js/Express.js, PostgreSQL, PostGIS
          
    - role: Software Developer (Internship)

      details: |
        Responsible for building a tablet application for simplifying the check-in process on hotels. This application was built from scratch
        using the NativeScript framework, which reads Angular/TypeScript code and generates both iOS and Android application
        files. Througout this internship I also helped build some new features on the company's main Web application and API.
